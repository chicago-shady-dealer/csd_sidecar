* Shady Dealer Redesign
** Overview
   This new version of the site will be a simple off-shoot of
   Linus. By creating a basic site that makes requests from Linus's
   API, parses them, and displays the result, we can leave most of the
   heavy duty lifting to Linus and it's already established database
   structure will having the added benefits of detaching the display
   of this content from it's actual location.
   
** Design
   I'd like this site to be simple with a lot of emphasis on simple
   black lines displayed over a white background. The header should be
   the exception (if it even is), utilizing the newly redesigned
   header image in NeoRetroDraw.
